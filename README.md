2. Write the swap16, swap32, swap64 functions that swap bytes in uint16_t, uint32_t, and uint64_t (endianness conversions). (solution in file task2.c)
3. Write a function that converts the RGB888 data format to RGB565. (solution in file task3.c)
4. Write a program that gets two values from a user: height and width of a rectangle in meters and calculates and prints the perimeter and the area of the rectangle in inches. (solution in file task4.c)
5. Write a program that computes the perimeter and the area of a circle with a radius of 6. (solution in file task5.c)
6. Write a program that computes the factorial of 10. (solution in file task6.c)
7. Write a program that prints all the integer numbers between 1 to 500 which are divisible by a number received from a user. (solution in file task7.c)
